				<p class="paragraph">LEDs for lighting solutions are gaining increasing importance in the shipping industry, based on their energy-saving potential and long service life. But the application places stringent demands on the quality of LED lighting.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">In modern cruise ships, lighting systems account for up to 25% of the total energy consumption which is not used for propulsion. This means that any reduction in electricity consumption for lighting leads to a positive impact on the ship&rsquo;s operating costs, as well as reducing the environmental impact. Light- ing providers such as LED Linear, Bluleu LED Solutions and Navalimpianti are already working with leading shipyards throughout Europe to develop efficient LED lighting solutions for cruise ships, including the giant Celebrity Equinox.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">In the shipping business, there are strict and demanding requirements when it comes to lighting. These include color rendering index (CRI) values of at least 80, light/color homogeneity, efficacy of at least 60 lm/W, warm white light of 3000K or less, and a long service life. Excellent weather resistance is also required, particularly for outdoor lighting. In addition, easy assembly and replaceability are required as well as standard sizing, in order to meet relevant standards and regulations.</p>

				<p class="paragraph">Aboard a state-of-the-art aircraft might be the last place you would think of yourself enjoying a warm candlelit dinner, followed by a good nights sleep under a starry night sky. The truth is, the latest aircraft cabins seek to provide just that &mdash; a revolutionary in-flight experience through the use of mood lighting. Mood lighting uses the full spectrum of colors and the ability to change these colors continuously with LEDs to mimic or enhance a sunrise morning or a bright, fresh afternoon or a cool evening that winds down the day. These light- ing effects even seek to reduce your likelihood of jet lag. LED lighting programs are specifically designed to gradually shift your waking and sleeping biorhythms to match that of your destination city.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">LED lighting is perfectly suited to create a containable and ever-changing lighting scheme using a combination of white and colored LEDs. In the design of the cabins of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A380, Lumileds partnered with Diehl Aerospace to optimize the interior lighting system design for maximum passenger comfort. &ldquo;Many years of research led to an optimized selection of various LED types and colors to achieve the best balance of containable lighting system and maximum energy efficiency,&rdquo; explained Mark van den Berg, Director of Marketing EMEA at Lumileds. Lumileds provided the LEDs while Diehl Aerospace engineered the overall lighting system for the Boeing and Airbus cabin interiors. &ldquo;The system creates a unique atmosphere in the aircraft,&rdquo; said van den Berg.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">&ldquo;LED technology can offer an overall energy savings of 35 to 55% relative to previous lighting systems,&rdquo; said Marc Renz from Diehl Aerospace. Contributing to this savings is the dramatically lower power consumption of LED technology but also the ability to easily dim the LEDs. This reduction in energy use, in addition to the smaller size and lighter weight of solid-state devices, reduces the aircraft&rsquo;s fuel consumption.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">In addition to fuel efficiency, maintenance has a direct effect on operating costs of an airline. LED lighting has a lifespan of approximately 50,000 hours 10x the life of incandescent, fluorescent or halogen bulbs. Furthermore, since LEDs are solid-state devices, they are much more robust to vibration and shock than light bulbs, so the maintenance requirement is even further diminished.</p>
