					<p class="paragraph introParagraphs">Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are beneficial to nearly any business. How- ever, the retail sector can gain the most from their easy installation, increased energy efficiency and lifetime cost savings. LED lighting can make all the difference in retail areas that experience high traffic, need greater proactive loss prevention measures or require consistent energy usage monitoring.</p>

				<p class="paragraph">Consider the last time you stood under a bright light for a long time and felt the heat emanating from it. Chances are it was a traditional-style incandescent light bulb. Such older technologies, also including high-intensity discharge lamps, tend to generate a lot of heat, making LEDs a viable alternative. For retail stores, this is an important factor to consider when upgrading or retrofit- ting lighting applications, as LEDs operate at lower temperatures to reduce cooling costs. LED lighting can be applied for indoor and outdoor retail applications and comes in several styles, colors and sizes to factor in the design aesthetic for retailers.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">By changing out bulbs or replacing old fixtures with new LED fixtures, customers can take full advantage of the potential for LEDs. In addition to their design appeal, LED lighting replacement bulbs, especially those that are energy star certified, offer longer lifespans than compact fluorescents or incandescent lighting resulting in reduced maintenance costs. They give off less heat and use 25-75% less energy than alternative bulbs, which lowers overall utility costs.</p>

				<p class="paragraph">As LED technology evolved in recent years, the use for these energy-efficient lighting products spread to encompass almost every type of retail lighting space imaginable. From clothing stores to grocery stores, back-of-the-business settings to consumer displays, LEDs can now be used to illuminate nearly every aspect of a retail business.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Lighting options can more effectively highlight a retailer&rsquo;s high-traffic areas and products to increase brand visibility. In fact, one of the main reasons LED lighting adoption continues to grow among retailers is its directional capability. Whereas CFLs and incandescent lamps spread light and heat across a wide area, LEDs can be aimed at specific areas or products because they are directional light sources. This makes highlighting certain products and drawing customers&rsquo; attention to them much easier. In fact, LEDs reached an installed base of 11.4 million lamps in 2012 (about 4.6% of the total directional lamp sockets), an increase from 2010, when LEDs had an installed base of less than 1%. 3 To demonstrate just how far the technology has progressed, PG&amp;E partnered with the California Lighting Technology Center to educate retailers on LED technology and help them better transition to such energy-efficient lighting. The Lux retail vignette showcased such lighting options as PAR38 and MR16 replacement lamps, commonly used in track lighting.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Retailers must also consider such principles as color temperature, color rendering and efficacy when applying directional lighting to retail displays. High performance LED bulbs and fixtures offer better color rendering, reduce glare and increase visibility due to an improved lens design, which helps make retail displays more attractive. Because product displays are constantly illuminated throughout the day, retailers should consider pairing LEDs with dimmers. Dimming light bulbs, for example, can reduce their wattage and output, which can help retailers save energy and create the right atmosphere for customers.</p>
