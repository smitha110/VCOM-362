				<p class="paragraph introParagraphs">Hard-to-reach ceilings, expansive spaces, hot or cold temperatures and long operating hours. These are challenges all industrial lighting designers face. LED lighting from GE Lighting saves maintenance time and energy over conventional HID and fluorescent lighting systems. Today, LED delivers better light distribution, visual acuity, color consistency and optical control with less watt- age, less waste and longer replacement intervals.</p>

				<p class="paragraph">High, hard-to-reach ceilings, expansive spaces, hot or cold temperatures, long operating hours and unique building characteristics can create lighting challenges and inefficiencies. That&rsquo;s why so many industrial facility managers turn to customized LED lighting solutions that maximize savings and improve performance throughout their facilities.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">In most industrial settings with ceilings 20 feet or lower, lighting design has been limited to conventional linear fluorescent systems &ndash; a technology that comes with its own limitations and inefficiencies. Often requiring more fixtures and providing less targeted light, they can be a major contributor to light waste and overhead costs. In addition to energy savings, LED fixtures can reduce the overall cost of ownership through rebate incentives, when available.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">LED lights and LED tubes lighting are ideal in conventional and cold storage facilities with a mixture of conditioned and unconditioned spaces. LED technology performs more consistently in cold temperatures than traditional fluorescent technology, making it a better choice in cold storage environments.</p>

				<p class="paragraph">Many conventional industrial lighting solutions, especially HID systems, are not compatible with advanced sensors and wireless controls. In addition, long strike-up times often force facility managers to leave these lights on round-the-clock. LED lighting offers advanced lighting controls that harvest daylight to reduce energy usage, or turn lights on and off at pre-designated times in pre-designated zones. Sensors and wireless controls from LED lights can ensure your LED lighting system works as hard as you do, operating efficiently without compromising aesthetics or productivity. Highly containable and scalable, LED lighting control systems can be tailored for one or multiple locations, putting greater comfort, safety and efficiency within reach.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Offices and functional areas such as meeting rooms, hallways, cafeterias and health facilities require more effective lighting to accommodate a wide range of tasks. Outdated or inefficient lighting can be harder to control, cause glare on screens and waste substantial amounts of energy and maintenance time. The latest LED lighting technology with stylish designs to create a more welcoming, productive office, from the lobby and conference rooms to the hallways and open work areas. The right lighting can positively impact emotions and how people feel about their space. LED lighting will help you transform your workplace with a combination of overhead, downlight, accent and architectural lighting that increases aesthetics and energy efficiency for a fast return on investment.</p>
				<p class="paragraph">Presenting your operation in the best possible light starts on the outside, including the parking lot. LED Area Lights deliver effective security light levels and reduced off-site visibility with symmetric and asymmetric light distributions. They also reduce system energy use from 40-70% compared to standard HID systems and virtually eliminate ongoing maintenance costs. LED garage lights offer significant energy and maintenance savings, effective security light levels, increased control and instant-on capabilities to optimize efficiency in parking areas. Our unique up-light version is a more driver-friendly solution that eliminates the &ldquo;cave effect&rdquo; that occurs with other LED lighting systems.</p>
